Repository for final verification work.
A program has been written in which an array of strings is entered from the keyboard and a new array is formed from strings whose length does not exceed 3 characters.

## The program uses three methods:

 - Entering an array of strings from the keyboard **(EnterStrArray)**
 - Getting a new array from an array with elements no longer than three characters in length **(GenStrArray)**
 - Output an array to the console **(PrintArray)**
## Examples of how the program works

**[ "hello" "2" "world" ":-)" ] -> [ "2" ":-)" ]**

**[ "Russia" "Denmark" "Kazan" ] -> [ ]**
